Compile with go build main.go.
Run with ./main -input=<input.jpg> -output=<output.jpg>.
Optional: Adjust output quality using -quality=75
This Go program features several key functions for image processing:
loadImage loads an image from a file, grayscale converts the image 
to grayscale, and applyConvolution applies an edge detection kernel 
(defined in getEdgeDetectionKernel) to highlight edges.
The saveImage function then saves the processed image. 
The program uses Go's concurrency for efficiency and supports command-line arguments for input, output, and JPEG quality settings.
the result is output.jpg
